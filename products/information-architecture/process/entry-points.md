# Entry Point and Crosslinks

An **entry point** is a CTA (can be a link, but is typically something more prominent) placed on a page or in navigation, where it is the primary intention of that page or component.  It is how a visitor would navigate to/discover a feature. Without an entry point, there is no way to navigate to a feature.

**Crosslinks** are links on a page or in navigation that are secondary to the page or area's purpose, but were placed there because they have a relationship.

There are three types that the IA specialist will document in the IA spec:

1. Primary entry point
2. Additional entry points
3. Suggested crosslinks

## Types

### Primary navigation pathway and entry point

**Primary navigation pathway:** A series of clicks(or interactions) that allows a user to navigate to the tool/form from the top menu on Va.gov. We outline this so we don't end up with orphaned pages that are only available via search. Teams must launch with at least one navigation pathway.

The pathway must include the **Primary entry point:** The final click (or interaction) before you get to the form/tool. The actual component may vary (it could be a sign-in widget, an action link, a standad link, a left nav link), but this is typicaly the furthest link you can access before you are on the tool/form. 

For forms, this interaction tends to be on a static Drupal page about the form or benefit. Drupal pages are created and managed by the CAIA content team -- teams must work with them to prepare their entry point BEFORE staging review. Teams will be required to come to Staging Review with a functioning URL (either for Drupal preview or staging) that is ready to publish.

The only exception to this is if the feature is only supposed to be accessible a specific way (i.e. check-in is only accessible via a text) either indefinitely or for some period of time for a silent launch that has been approved by OCTO (i.e. MHV on Va.gov tools).

### Secondary entry points
Secondary entry points are any additional locations that the page should be navigable from. This is often an about form page, an R&S page about the feature, or even a best bet. These are secondary, and while they are still very important, are not required for launch. They are most often set up post-launch, because there is no draft/preview state for some of these items in Drupal. 

Ex: mega menu, left nav, find-a-form, benefit hub pages


### Crosslinks
Crosslinks are not fully IA responsibility. If there are specific pages or places that we believe should should also reference the feature, we can call those out. Ultimately, the content team knows the content very well and can add crosslinks across the site. There might not always be any crosslink recommendations; it's more of a place to document any other places that we stumble upon or that a team asks about.

Crosslinks are also iterative and can change depending on page performance and other factors.
