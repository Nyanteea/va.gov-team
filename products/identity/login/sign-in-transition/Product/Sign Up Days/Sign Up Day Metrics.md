# Sign Up Day Metrics

Sign Up Day volunteers will be responsible for collecting the following metrics for each Sign Up Day event:

## Veteran Volume

How many Veterans: 
- Interacted with the team and received new information?
- Created new accounts?
- Verified?


## Process Efficiency
- How long did it take to set up the new account and verify?
- Did the Veteran get stuck and if so where?

## Staff Availability

- Who were the staff available for this event?

## Staff Bandwidth

- How much time did the staff dedicate to helping Veterans today?

## Staff Confidence

- Staff confidence in supporting Veterans during transition?
- Measure after training, during Sign Up Day, and afterwards? 

## Template
As a part of Sign Up Day participation,  a team representative will be asked to report out on metrics so that OCTO may understand the impact of the event. This template should be filled out and emailed back to the SSiT team no more than a week later following the completion of a Sign Up Day event. Please note that the last two metrics are captured at two points of time: once following Sign Up Day training and once following the Sign Up Day event.
