# Conversation Guide: BUSINESS LINE TEMPLATE
*Ask VA, June 2023*

Last updated by @tygindraux: July 14, 2023

## Research goal

Our goal is to **understand which fields are necessary in order for agents to deliver Ask VA (AVA)**. These are our research questions:

* How do agents answer an inquiry (step-by-step)?
* Who uses the answers to each question in this form?
* What do they use the answers to each question for?
* Which fields are required in order to answer a query?
* If an answer is required, what happens if a submitter enters something random in order to get through the form?
* Why are optional questions part of the form?
* How does this process differ across use cases (or categories and topics), if at all?
* What makes it take longer to offer a response to the submitter?

## Prepare

### 1-2 days before the session
- [ ] Create a new folder [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/research/Question%20protocol) and name it the business line or category name, here's an [example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/research/Question%20protocol/Health)
- [ ] Make a copy of the conversation guide and replace 'BUSINESS LINE TEMPLATE' with the business line or category name

## Agenda - 60 minutes

* Set up: 5 minutes
* Background: 15 minutes
* Review form: 25 minutes
* Category, topics and sub-topics: 10 minutes
* Wrap up: 5 minutes

## Set up - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining. Today is a chance for us to learn more about how Ask VA works. In particular, we'd like to understand how agents use the details in each inquiry to reply to a submitter. Understanding your process will help us improve AVA.

* Before we start, I'd like to record this meeting for our notes. Is everyone okay with us recording? Please raise your hand if not, or feel free to turn off your camera.

> Start recording.

* Thank you. I'd like to start by asking everyone on your team introduce themselves? If you can share your name and your role, please.
    * *Note: If the invite list is over 5 people from their team, we should skip this.*

## Background - 15 minutes

I'd like to start by learning about the type of inquiries you're responsible for.

* Which types of inquiries does your team answer?
* Can you walk us through the process of how an agent answers an inquiry (step-by-step)?
* What makes it easier to answer an inquiry?
* What makes it difficult?
   * What makes it take longer to answer a particular inquiry?
* There's currently a question in AVA that asks why someone is getting in touch. A submitter can choose, ‘compliment, question, town hall,’ and so on. How do you use this information to help answer a submitter's question?
   * We've heard that this field is often answered incorrectly, so the data isn't used much. We recommend removing this question. What do you think about removing this question? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

## Review form: 35 minutes

Next, we're going to share our screen and ask for your feedback. This is an updated version of AVA that we've been working on.

> Share screen with Sketch prototype

### Start page

This is the start page. We're going to imagine that a submitter starts by signing in. I'm going to skip ahead to the first page of the form now.

### About you

I'd like to ask a couple questions about this screen now. On this screen, the submitter tells us who they are, so we know what information to collect from them. This question currently exists on AVA.

* Why do you need to know whether any submitter is a VA employee?
   * We noticed this field isn't required, how do you feel about removing this question?
* Sometimes we need to collect the Veteran's Date of Death, but this isn't required. How does this help you reply to their query?
* We noticed that if someone says they are submitting a general question, they need to provide their zip code. Do you know why a zip code is required?
* Is there anything else on this page that you would change? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

### Category and topic

On this screen, the submitter chooses a category, topic and sub-topic. This is very similar to the current AVA.

* Do you face any issues related to the current categories, topics and sub-topics in Ask VA?
   * For example, do submitters ever choose the incorrect category?
   * Can you share an example of when this (or something else) happened?
* Is there anything else on this page that you would change? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

### Your question

On this screen, the submitter tells us more about their inquiry.

* Do you have any issues with the current free-text box, where submitters can write their inquiry in their own words?
* Can submitters upload documents with their inquiry?
    * If yes, do you face any issues with this?
    * If not, could this be useful? How?
* Is there anything else on this page that you would change? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

### Your information (or the Veteran's, or the dependent's)

On this screen, the submitter gives information about themself, the Veteran or the dependent, depending on who is submitting a query.

* What information do you need about a Veteran in order to answer an inquiry?
    * For example, do you need to know a Veteran's service dates?
    * Is there anything on this page that you think could be removed?
* How do you reply to submitter's? For example, over the phone, email, or mail.
    * We noticed that submitter's can choose which contact method they prefer. If they choose to be contacted over the phone, will you only contact them that way?
    * Is there any circumstance where you would call them instead?
* Is there anything else on these information pages that you would change? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

### Review and send

At the end, the submitter will have the chance to review their information before they submit.

* Is there anything on this page that you would change? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*
  
### Submitted

Finally, they will submit their inquiry and we'll tell them what to expect next.

* How long does it usually take you to reply to an inquiry?
    * Are you comfortable with us stating that it takes up to 7 business days to reply to an inquiry? 
* Is there anything else on this page that you would change? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

## Category, topics and subtopics - 10 minutes

Before we finish, there’s something else we’d like to get your feedback on. We’ve reviewed the list of categories, topics and subtopics and made suggestions for how to update these so they are consistent with content on VA.gov. This will not affect how the queries are routed to the correct queue.

> Share screen with spreadsheet

* First, the category is currently named [current category name]. We suggest changing this to [proposed category name].
   * How do you feel about this change?
* Next, here are the topics in this category, and on the right you can see our proposed changes.
   * How do you feel about these changes?
   * Is there any one that sticks out to you?
* Finally, there are subtopics within [this topic]. Here are our proposed changes to the subtopics.
   * How do you feel about these changes?
   * Is there any one that sticks out to you?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

### Wrap up - 5 minutes

Thanks for reviewing this with us. It's really helpful to get your feedback.

* Before we finish, is there anything else you want to share with us?
* Do you have any hesitations about anything we showed you today?
* Do you have any questions for us?
* *Any specific questions for this business line?*
