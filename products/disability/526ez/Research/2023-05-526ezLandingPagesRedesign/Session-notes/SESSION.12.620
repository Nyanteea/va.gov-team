## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about [description of your project].

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. Your feedback is helping us improve the language on these pages so it’s a better experience for veterans. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will be compensated regardless of whether you complete the session or answer all the questions.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with [VA.gov](http://va.gov/). (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? I did.

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

- Are you currently a veteran or active duty?
- Can you remind me where you are based?
- Can you remind me of whether you have applied for any VA benefits before? (for determining which scenario to present) Yes, I have a disability benefit.
How was the application process? It was very difficult. I did not do it online. I was told by another Veteran about a VSO who helped me submit the claim. 
Were you aware you could do it online? Yes, I have gone back into it online to submit another claim, but I never got through the process because I found it difficult. 
Could you tell me what was difficult? It is the terminology about what the benefit claim says about what the Veteran needs to have. I have a health diagnosis and the website goes against what my other doctor says I have. I also have issues with the burn pits and how does that apply my condition. It is like putting it into a story to have a timeline to put onto my application. I go into a word document and put my words down to put into the claim, but I never done that. I know there has been a lot of traffic talking about lawyers that are available for Veterans who will help us through the process. I just don’t know about calling a lawyer. I don’t know what they want. 
Do you have to pay for the lawyers? I don’t know.
- What is your experience with VA.gov, if any? I have an account with the VA, I have had surgery there, and I have my primary and specialty doctors there. I have had virtual appointments with my doctors at the VA. 

## First Task: [intro & TE alert] - 5 minutes


###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand the intro and what language they find clear/confusing 

- Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario,* 
- Take a moment to look over the page. What is the first thing you would do after arriving on this page? [emphasize more after first few interviews] The first thing I would looking for is anything to do with my conditions. I have seen two things right off the bat, one for Agent Orange and the other for the burn pits. The one thing about cancer is they are very specific. I know I would have to sign in.
- Read everything on this page up until the “Sign in” button at your own pace. You can read aloud or to yourself. Try to look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. If questions come up for you as your e reading, feel free to say them out loud.  Let me know when you are finished, and then I will ask you a few questions.
- Do you think the information here could be clearer? how so? No, I am very familiar with the PACT and there is a button there to file a supplemental claim, but I know I have to sign in first.
What is your understanding of a supplemental claim? I know it is a claim you do to submit additional documentation for claims that have been denied.
- On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all useful, and 10 being very useful, how useful or not was the information in this section of the page? For me this is very helpful. There are 3 ways I could continue to help my situation. Up on top I think it is helpful and nice to know. I like the links that are provided up there. The search I don’t use that much because the drop downs really provide the links to where I would go. I also keep my own records for contact information.
    - Why did you choose that number?
-  Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- From what you’ve read here, what is your understanding of who qualifies for benefits under the PACT act?
       alt: if you had to explain the new PACT act to someone else, how would you put it ?      

## Second Task: [STEP 1] Is this the form for you - 10 minutes

###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand step 1 and what language they find clear/confusing + 
gauging expandable sections UX on mobile + gauge expandable alert interaction 

- Same as before: Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario to participant*
- MOBILE: Without clicking on anything just yet, look at the steps listed here. What do they tell you about the process for claiming disability comp. if anything?
- From what you have seen so far, what are some actions you think you can take on this page? 

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see when you open section 1? Well, there is a little confusing in there. It states I need to file a supplemental claim instead of this form, but I need to file both because I need to file a supplemental claim for my cancer and then I would need to file this for a new claim. I would create the new benefit claim before I would go in to do the supplemental claim. I like what they say, at least one of these must be true so you can read through it, and you feel as if you are allowed to continue instead of having to go through the whole form before you find out you are not qualified.
Do you feel like there is information here that you don’t think should be here? I don’t think so. I think it would be nice, the last bullet would be nice if you added a link to the PACT Act change because then you may have to back out to search those changes and may lose where you are at. I would expect the link to take me to the change in the PACT Act that affects that law. I just want to know what they are talking about.
Did you notice the alert? Yes, I did. 
Would you be likely to click on that alert? Probably not. I do have a benefit but that is not why I am here. I don’t know if my benefit would affect me filing a new claim. I don’t want to lose this page so I would not click on it.
Can you click on it? That is very informative. I would follow up on that. I would make a note on that because it gives me a path for a claim I have already submitted.
Were you aware of a claim of increase? I am thankful for my benefit and never thought of doing that prior to this alert. With the VA granting my benefit and I was just grateful that I got it.
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section 1 of the form 

- Read Step 1 on this page at your own pace and look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. Let me know when you have finished. Feel free to read out loud or to yourself.  If questions come up for you as your e reading, feel free to say them out loud.

- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful or not was the information in this section?
    - Why did you choose that number?
    - Is there information here that you feel is not useful to you?

- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- From what you read, what is your understanding of who is eligible for disability benefits?
   - ALT: If you had to explain to someone else this information about who is eligible for disability benefits, what would you phrase it?
- From what you read here, what is your understanding of a supplemental claim form?
     - ALT: If you had to explain to someone what a supplemental claim is, how would you phrase it?

QUESTIONS CONCERNING EXPANDABLE ALERT UI/ INFO

- Do you think the alert will contain information relevant to your situation of *insert scenario*? why or why?
- Is this the information you expected to see here? why or why not?
- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer, IF ANY?
- What is your understanding of the information about veterans who have been granted benefits in the past?

### Things to watch for:

- Are certain words/language tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over / miss
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section 

## Third Task: [STEP 2] Decide how to apply - 3 minutes

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see when you open section 2?  I like the first sentence to begin with. Section 2 is very informative, but I didn’t know I could start a claim and then contact a VSO. Would they be able to see what I was doing? When I went to a VSO originally, I never saw what they were doing. If I choose to contact a VSO, would it be my VSO or any VSO that is available? It goes on to state that you can contact you Office of Veteran Affairs, I don’t want to do that I want to talk to my VSO. I already developed a relationship with my VSO. It doesn’t say if I could contact them online or if I would have to go to them. 
Is there anything else you would like to know? That last link tells you other ways you can submit a claim. I would like to click on that to see other ways there are. It just says contact a credited VSO, but it doesn’t say we would be online.
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section two
- Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario,* read step 2 on this page at your own pace and look for any information relevant to your situation. If questions come up for you as you're reading, feel free to ask them. 
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section? Actually, I found this very informative, I would say 8 or 9 because I would probably go look at multiple things on here.
    - Why did you choose that number?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Which parts of this section do you think could be clearer, if any?


### Things to watch for:

- How do vets/service members react to mentions of form completion time?
- Are certain words/language tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over / miss
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section 

## Fourth Task: [Step 3] Gather information - 10 minutes

###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand step 1 and what language they find clear/confusing + 
gauging expandable sections UX on mobile + gauge expandable alert interaction 

- IF ON MOBILE: What do you expect to see when you expand section 3? If this is true, this is a major benefit because the first real paragraph states you will review medical records from the VA and other private medical facilities. I know it has been very difficult with Tricare and they will refer you to an outside hospital. It is important that you are allowed to submit outside medical records. I don’t recall if that was allowed before. They don’t tell you why they denied you. It is nice to know to have your records ready to submit. The last bullets are really the meat of the paragraph. The records will not show that your disability has gotten worse. You may have gotten a claimed okayed, but over time it has escalated and that is the whole purpose of the supplemental claim. That is one that I didn’t know family members/people you deal with in your normal life could submit statements to tell them how your disability has gotten worse.
Is there a way we could make it clearer? We have Duke and they have My Chart which is an online medical connection and I have 3 locations using My Chart and they all talk to one another. If something happens to me at one of those locations, the other providers are made aware. It would be nice if the VA would be able to connect to those as well. On top you should state that the Veteran needs to provide the records that the VA would review.
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section three
- As before, read through this section at your own pace. Let me know once you’re finished. look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. 
- In your own words, what is the gist of the information in this section?
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section?
    - Why did you choose that number?
    - Is there information here that you feel is not useful to you? 
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Was any of this information confusing or unclear?
- What is your understanding of the information you read about how disability compensation is determined?
    ALT: Imagine you needed to explain to someone else how disability compensation is determined? How would you explain it?
- What is your understanding of the information you read about what documents are needed to support a claim for disability benefits?
    - ALT: Imagine you needed to explain to someone this information about the types of documentation needed to support a claim for benefits. How would you explain it to them?
  
**CHECK TIME**

- Was anything confusing about the information pertaining to authorizing the VA to receive and review your medical records?
- Was anything confusing about the information concerning where to submit forms for claiming PTSD or unemployability?

QUESTIONS CONCERNING EXPANDABLE UI/INFO - BDD

- Do you think the alert will contain information relevant to your situation of *insert scenario*? why or why not?
- Before you opened this section, was this the information you expected to see here? Why or why not?
- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer, if any?
- In your own words, what is your understanding of the benefits delivery at discharge program?
    - If you had to explain the Benefits Delivery at Discharge program to someone else, how 
        would you do that? 

### Things to watch for:

- Are certain words/langauge tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over/miss 
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section


## Fifth Task: [Step 4] Apply - 8 minutes

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see in this section? For me this is like a review, and it is a good review.
I wanted to ask you about the 3 kinds of claims, which of the 3 apply to you? I got a new claim that I am going to be submitting, I’ve been thinking about it. Increase in benefits, that would be the one I now have, and the supplemental claim is the one that has been denied. I would need all of them,
Is there anything that you wish you knew that is not here? I like the fact that you keep repeating that you have a year to file any documents you may need. You could probably submit the claim within a week as long as you have everything that you need to do. There may be something that comes up that you can add to it. It Is very informative. It is straightforward and I like the parts where it helps you think about what path you want to take.
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section four
- Read through section at your own pace…
- In your own words, what is the gist of the information in this section?
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section?
    - Why did you choose that number?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Which parts of this section do you think could be clearer?
- If you had to explain "intent to file" to someone else, how would you put it?
- What did you think when you read the text about the length of time the VA takes to make a decision?
   - Did you find that information useful or not useful?

**If not mentioned before and within the allotted time:**

- What is your understanding of the information regarding additional forms like those for dependents and aid?

SENTIMENT AND TRUST TESTING 

- In your opinion, is there a difference between the words “condition” and “disability”?
- On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all prepared and 10 being extremely prepared, how prepared or not do you feel to begin the 526 form after reading this page?
- How likely or unlikely would you be to reach out to a VSO for help  completing the form?
- Now that you have read through this page, is there any information missing from this page that you feel is needed to equip veterans to begin the form on their own?
- If we needed to shorten this page, is there any information you think we could take out? 
- From what you have seen here, how long do you think completing the form digitally would take you?


**ONE OF THE FOLLOWING DEPENDING ON TIME:**

- Personally, why do you think the VA asks for evidence when applying for disability benefits?
- Do you agree or disagree that the VA expects a reasonable amount of documentation to support a claim for benefits/compensation. Why so?
    - ALT: Do you believe it is necessary for the VA to collect "evidence” from you to support your claim for benefits/compensation? why or why not?
- How would you describe the overall tone of the text on this page? E.G. corporate, warm, cold, etc.


## START PAGE BDD TASKS - 5 MIN

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## 

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

If participant becomes nervous , anxious, or irritated -

how are you feeling? do you want to take a few minutes to yourself?

You have already helped us a lot and given us some good information, it’s ok to take a break or even end now if you need to

We’ve been talking a lot, do you want to take a break before we start again?
