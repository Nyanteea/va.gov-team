### **Zoom logistics**

- _In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute._
- _In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked_
- _Check your \[screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro_


## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME] and \[NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about helping veterans be more successful in deciding what claims to file.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- Feel free to ask any questions you may have at any point, but just know ahead of time that I may not be able to answer them until the end of the session.

- You'll be interacting with a prototype. This may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.

- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
  - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
  - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**


## Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Tell us a little bit about yourself:

  - What branch of the military did you serve in?
  - When did you leave the military?

- Talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov?

- Could you tell me about the types of benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 

  - _If they are getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:_


- About how many conditions are you rated for?

- If you’re comfortable sharing this information, what are some of those conditions?  
  _Note: we may already know some of these conditions from the screener. Check the spreadsheet before the session to see the participant’s answers_

  - If they’re rated for Tinnitus:

    - At what percent?
    - How long ago did you get rated for Tinnitus?
    - How severe is your tinnitus now? 
    - Is it better or worse than when you first filed a claim for it?


## **Task A : Request CFI for 3 conditions - 10 minutes**

_\[Moderator note: switch between starting with Task A and Task B throughout the study]_

For this first task, I would like you to imagine that you already receive disability benefits from the VA for a few service-connected health conditions. I’d like to have you walk us through how you would request an increase to your benefits for Tinnitus, Asthma and Migraines today. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. Start by \[Click ‘Begin Scenario 2’ - then view prototype screen 1]. From here, show me how you would start the process of requesting an increase for the conditions mentioned.

\[after clicking - Prototype screen 2]

\[after clicking - Prototype screen 3]

Thanks for that! I have a few questions for you on this screen before you proceed.

- What can you tell me about the conditions on this screen?
- What can you tell me about your eligibility for more benefits?
- Can you tell me about the messaging for Tinnitus and what you think it means?
- What do you think you would do after reading that message about Tinnitus?
- Which of these conditions do you think qualifies for an increase in benefits?

Go ahead and click on any of the conditions for which you’d plan to request an increase in benefits.

\[after clicking - Prototype screen 4]

\[after clicking - Prototype screen 5]

- Tell me a little about what that task was like for you? 


### **Things to watch for:**

- _Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus?_ 
- _Do they want to go ahead and claim the other condition that’s not at the max (asthma)?_
- _How do they react to seeing a condition (migraines) that’s also at the max rating but doesn't have a message?_


## **Task B: Request CFI for Tinnitus only - 10 minutes**

We will now look at a similar scenario where you have already been rated for a few conditions, but in this scenario, you only want to request an increase for Tinnitus.

\[Click ‘Begin Scenario 2]

\[after clicking - Prototype screen 2]

\[after clicking - Prototype screen 3]

- What can you tell me about the conditions on this screen?
- What can you tell me about your eligibility for more benefits?
- Which of these conditions do you think qualifies for an increase in benefits?

\[after clicking - Prototype screen 4]

- Can you tell me about the messaging for Tinnitus and what you think it means?
- What do you think you would do after reading that message about Tinnitus?

\[after clicking - Prototype screen 5]

- Tell me a little about what that task was like for you?


### **Things to watch for:**

- _Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus?_ 


## **Post-Task Interview: Most recent CFI - 20 minutes**

Now that we’ve been through those scenarios, let’s talk about your actual experience with your own disability claims. I’d like to just let you know up front that if you do not wish to answer any of these questions, we can absolutely skip them - just let me know if that comes up.

- Can you tell me about your most recent experience filing a claim on VA.gov?

  - Tell me about any resources you used or people that helped you?
  - Have you ever requested an increase for any of your rated conditions? 


- _If yes, go to Section A_
- _If no, go to Section B_


#### **A. They have filed a claim for increase…**

- When was the most recent claim for increase you filed? 


- What was your rating when you filed?

- Can you tell us why you decided to ask for an increase, and what went into your decision?

- Did you get any outside advice? From whom? What did they tell you?

- How did you file? Step by step, what did you do?

- Did you submit any new evidence?

- What did you expect to happen?

  - Was there a specific % rating you were hoping to get? Why?

- What has happened so far?

- Have you gotten a decision back?

  - If yes, what was the decision?

    - What do you think of the decision? 
    - Do you know why they made that decision?

  - If no, What do you think are your chances of success?

(If they haven’t already discussed the rating schedule for the condition)

Thinking about \[the condition they filed an increase for], do you know what the different possible percentage ratings are?

- What is the highest rating you can get?
- What does it take to get the highest rating?


#### **B. They have not filed a claim for increase…**

Have you thought about filing a claim for increase on the any of the conditions you’re already been rated for?

If yes:

- What has prompted you to think about asking for an increase?

- What are the possible percentages you could get for this?

  - What’s the highest rating the VA gives for this?
  - What do you think it takes to get to the highest rating?

- Are you still considering requesting an increase, or did you decide not to?

  - If still considering: What will go into your decision?
  - If not: What went into your decision not to?

_If no: go to section C_


#### **C. (Skip here if) They’re not comfortable discussing a specific condition during the session**

If one of your disabilities got worse, would you consider asking the VA for more compensation?

- Why or why not?

- How would you know if you might be eligible for more compensation?

- How much do you pay attention to what the different possible rating percentages are?

- Can you describe briefly how the rating system works?

- Are you at the maximum rating for any of your disabilities?

  - If that disability got worse, would you still consider asking the VA for an increase?
  - Why or why not?
  - Do you think it’s possible to get  more compensation if you’re at the highest rating already? If so, how?


## **Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


## **Emergency Exit**

Well, we have covered all of the questions I had for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback!
