# Appointments home page

## Overview
Starting page to schedule or manage appointments.

## User stories

- As a Veteran I want a starting point for all of my appointment scheduling and management tasks

## Requirements

**Functional**
<!-- What the system should do in order to meet the user's needs (see user stories.) These are the aspects of the feature that the user can detect. -->

- If user/Veteran is ineligible to use VAOS because they are not registered at a VA facility. In that case, the [alert that user is not registered at a VA facility](#alert-that-user-is-not-registered-at-a-va-facility) displays


## User interface design

[User flow](Add link) 

[Page template](Add link)

[Page content](Add link)

## Metrics
<!--Goals for this feature, and how we track them through analytics-->

- Goal 1
- Goal 2

**Events tracked**
<!-- Descriptions of events tracked on this page to meet those goals -->

- Event 1
- Event 2

[All events VAOS tracks](Link TBD)

## Alerts and conditional states
<!-- Any alerts that could display for this feature and what triggers them. -->

### Alert that user is not registered at a VA facility
<!-- Add a new section for each alert -->

**Alert trigger**

VAOS checks if the facilities field that comes back from `vaProfile` is empty. If it is, this alert replaces all content on the page.
