- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).

### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about [description of your project].

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. Your feedback is helping us improve the language on these pages so it’s a better experience for veterans. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will be compensated regardless of whether you complete the session or answer all of the questions.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with [VA.gov](http://va.gov/). (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes, yup.

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

- Are you currently a veteran or active duty?
- Can you remind me where you are based?
- Can you remind me of whether you have applied for any VA benefits before? (for determining which scenario to present) Yup in the past I have applied through a VSO. The most recent there were some updates that happened back in December. Over the past two years I have submitted 2-3 claims. 
- What is your experience with VA.gov, if any? All the above. I have gotten things approved, denied, a little bit of it all.
Did you attempt to do the form alone? I started with a VSO because I had a personal relationship with him. I decided if I were to do it again that I would just do it on my own because of all the knowledge I have gained.

## First Task: [intro & TE alert] - 5 minutes


###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand the intro and what language they find clear/confusing 

- Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario,* 
- Take a moment to look over the page. What is the first thing you would do after arriving on this page? [emphasize more after first few interviews] If I launched this, I would go through the whole page to see what it looks like. I would probably click on some of these to see, but if I knew what I was getting into I would sign in to get started. This all looks pretty normal.
- Read everything on this page up until the “Sign in” button at your own pace. You can read aloud or to yourself. Try to look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. If questions come up for you as your e reading, feel free to say them out loud.  Let me know when you are finished, and then I will ask you a few questions.
- Do you think the information here could be clearer? how so? It seems pretty clear that it is for the PACT Act and toxic exposure. There is information in here, like it would backdate to the day the bill signing as long as it is completed this year, that is good to know. The truth is I have been keeping up to date with the PACT because I was deployed in Iraq back in 2005. By reading through this pulley, I have learned some things I did not know before. I know this is top of mind, I think this would be beneficial for any Veteran to sign up for not just those who were not in the PACT area.
- On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all useful, and 10 being very useful, how useful or not was the information in this section of the page? Before reading it all I would say 3 or 4, but after reading it all I would say a 6 or 7.
    - Why did you choose that number? I think it is more personal because I have been following the PACT stuff once I see the header, I would assume that I didn’t need to read that because I would have thought I knew all that stuff. Without you telling me to read it, I would have passed right by it. I would probably say 7 or 8 because of the dates that are provided within this paragraph.
-  Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know? I guess if someone already knew they were not part of the PACT it wouldn’t be important to them.
- From what you’ve read here, what is your understanding of who qualifies for benefits under the PACT act?
       alt: if you had to explain the new PACT act to someone else, how would you put it ?   
Would you start with section 1? I think I expanded and closed #1 it took me to the top of the page, which I would not want because that would be annoying.   Also, I do not like to expand all. I like to expand the thing I am reading and close it after reading that section to expand the next section as I go through.

## Second Task: [STEP 1] Is this the form for you - 10 minutes

###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand step 1 and what language they find clear/confusing + 
gauging expandable sections UX on mobile + gauge expandable alert interaction 

- Same as before: Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario to participant*
- MOBILE: Without clicking on anything just yet, look at the steps listed here. What do they tell you about the process for claiming disability comp. if anything?
- From what you have seen so far, what are some actions you think you can take on this page? 
In general, all this information is important, especially for those who have never filed a claim because you typically don’t know the process of filing a claim. I guess that covers even for me. To me this is a good summary and makes sense. It would cover everything you would want to know. It is a full summary about what Veterans are eligible to file a claim and what it all entails. If something is not covered it goes over that.
- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see when you open section 1?
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section 1 of the form 

- Read Step 1 on this page at your own pace and look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. Let me know when you have finished. Feel free to read out loud or to yourself.  If questions come up for you as your e reading, feel free to say them out loud.

- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful, or not was the information in this section? I would say I would rate it pretty high especially for someone who has not filed a claim before. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Who would be covered, and if this form would be good for a certain Veteran. 
    - Why did you choose that number?
    - Is there information here that you feel is not useful to you?

- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- From what you read, what is your understanding of who is eligible for disability benefits?
   - ALT: If you had to explain to someone else this information about who is eligible for disability benefits, what would you phrase it?
- From what you read here, what is your understanding of a supplemental claim form? My understanding is that if you have already submitted and been denied and you want to do something extra to provide more information you would want to file a supplemental claim. Also, if your disability has worsened you would want to file for an increase. I know that you could file for your claim to be increased. 
Is it clear that a claim for increase and supplemental claim are different? From the order it seems like that they are the same. The way it flows it seems as they are just giving more information about the supplemental claim so it would be the same thing. 
     - ALT: If you had to explain to someone what a supplemental claim is, how would you phrase it?

QUESTIONS CONCERNING EXPANDABLE ALERT UI/ INFO

- Do you think the alert will contain information relevant to your situation of *insert scenario*? why or why?
- Is this the information you expected to see here? why or why not? I think it covers the basics of why you would use this form.
- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer, IF ANY?
- What is your understanding of the information about veterans who have been granted benefits in the past?

### Things to watch for:

- Are certain words/language tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over / miss
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section 

## Third Task: [STEP 2] Decide how to apply - 3 minutes

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see when you open section 2? 
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section two
- Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario,* read step 2 on this page at your own pace and look for any information relevant to your situation. If questions come up for you as you're reading, feel free to ask them. 
I think this one is a little bit confusing to me. It says decide how you want to apply. I think the first section is leading you just use this form, and then here it states you may want to contact the VSO. Would the VSO use this form as well because I was always under the impression that the VSO uses this page as well? It says decide how you want to apply. It is not clear reading through this. The first section makes you think you would go through here on your own, but the second paragraph makes you feel as though you would go through with a VSO. It looks like you can also contact the State office of Veteran Affairs. Thinking of this as prepping to fill this form online yourself, the first part should prop you to go through on your own not go through with someone else. The first paragraph makes it seem like it is covering this new online form. I don’t know. Maybe I am reading too much into it. To me it would be confusing, especially for a new Veteran who has never filed a claim before. I could be wrong with this it seems like you would not go forward if you decided to go to a VSO. If you are here, you want to do it on your own digitally.
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section?
    - Why did you choose that number?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Which parts of this section do you think could be clearer, if any?


### Things to watch for:

- How do vets/service members react to mentions of form completion time?
- Are certain words/language tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over / miss
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section 

## Fourth Task: [Step 3] Gather information - 10 minutes

###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand step 1 and what language they find clear/confusing + 
gauging expandable sections UX on mobile + gauge expandable alert interaction 

- IF ON MOBILE: What do you expect to see when you expand section 3? That all makes sense. I think for me I am used to the VSO telling me everything. I am not used to knowing all this information and why things happen. This is not important for me; it would be important for me if I was active duty.
You never heard of the program while you were active? No, I have not. To me this is not important to me because I am not on active duty. This whole yellow section would have been nice to read when I got out. I always thought the VA medical records/military records were automatically available to you. I was never aware of what I should have provided since I was working with a VSO.
Does it change your thoughts on how the process will be? I think it just clarifies what I would want to do. It would just make me want to submit all documents even if they may have it.
Do you think anything is missing? I can’t think of anything offhand. This is a good summary of what you would want to have. I think it is good preparation to give prior to starting the process.
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section three
- As before, read through this section at your own pace. Let me know once you’re finished. look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. 
- In your own words, what is the gist of the information in this section?
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section? I think fairly high. I think I knew most of this stuff since I worked with a VSO. Just knowing if you don’t already have supporting letters you may want to get on that for you. I think the list is a good list to start the process. I would put this up to an 8 or 9 for someone who has never applied. For someone who has applied I would say a 6 or 7.
    - Why did you choose that number?
    - Is there information here that you feel is not useful to you? 
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Was any of this information confusing or unclear?
- What is your understanding of the information you read about how disability compensation is determined?
    ALT: Imagine you needed to explain to someone else how disability compensation is determined? How would you explain it?
- What is your understanding of the information you read about what documents are needed to support a claim for disability benefits?
    - ALT: Imagine you needed to explain to someone this information about the types of documentation needed to support a claim for benefits. How would you explain it to them?
  
**CHECK TIME**

- Was anything confusing about the information pertaining to authorizing the VA to receive and review your medical records?
- Was anything confusing about the information concerning where to submit forms for claiming PTSD or unemployability?

QUESTIONS CONCERNING EXPANDABLE UI/INFO - BDD

- Do you think the alert will contain information relevant to your situation of *insert scenario*? why or why not?
- Before you opened this section, was this the information you expected to see here? Why or why not?
- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer, if any?
- In your own words, what is your understanding of the benefits delivery at discharge program?
    - If you had to explain the Benefits Delivery at Discharge program to someone else, how 
        would you do that? 

### Things to watch for:

- Are certain words/langauge tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over/miss 
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section


## Fifth Task: [Step 4] Apply - 8 minutes

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see in this section? I am not sure what I would see here. I like the first sentence. It sounds like they would take you through each step of the process. That is useful to see. It sounds like when you start the application online you are starting your intent to file. If this was a veteran who had never done this before it would affect the backdate. For me it wasn’t an issue, but since I started my claim with the VSO, I have learned more information about the process. I can’t remember if my VSO was very clear on the intent to file because everything was just important for the intent to file. I felt like I was rushing things because I wanted to ensure they had all the information they needed. Just being clear on the year timeline is helpful to see that. I guess for myself do you know if when they state they will not send another notification does that mean they will stop all communications? I typically screenshot the confirmation page but what if you lose that screenshot would I get a confirmation through email? I am assuming they would not receive an email that I did submit it. It is a personal thing because I know there are ways to look up your claims. I just wish there was an email. I think it all makes sense. One thing that is confusing, it states that you open all emails and letters from the VA. When I was going through my claims, I would get mail that I would receive letters that the date window had already been closed. That part is confusing to me as it was happening and reading through this I don’t know if I need to respond would be clear in the letters. I would be curious about the options of uploading evidence to the claim. I would want to click on that to see what it calls out. 
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section four
- Read through section at your own pace…
- In your own words, what is the gist of the information in this section? I guess I hadn’t, I guess some of this stuff would not be directed toward me. Personally, I feel like most of the other ones besides the dependents would be directed towards me. Glancing at it, maybe dependents should be at the top. 
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section?
    - Why did you choose that number?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know? I think it covers most of everything. My one concern, I may skip over a lot of this. As I read through, I noticed important information, but for me I like to jump into the form and figure out as I went through. I don’t know if I would have read through it naturally. I think it covers the information in a good way that you wouldn’t mind reading through top to bottom. To me if I started, I would just sign in on the first blue button. I do think it covers everything I would want to know, and I could jump onto another page if I wanted more information.
- Which parts of this section do you think could be clearer?
- If you had to explain "intent to file" to someone else, how would you put it?
- What did you think when you read the text about the length of time the VA takes to make a decision?
   - Did you find that information useful or not useful?
How could we make it clearer? I guess reading through it with fresh eyes you would need to file
**If not mentioned before and within the allotted time:**

- What is your understanding of the information regarding additional forms like those for dependents and aid?

SENTIMENT AND TRUST TESTING 

- In your opinion, is there a difference between the words “condition” and “disability”?
- On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all prepared and 10 being extremely prepared, how prepared or not do you feel to begin the 526 forms after reading this page?
- How likely or unlikely would you be to reach out to a VSO for help  completing the form?
- Now that you have read through this page, is there any information missing from this page that you feel is needed to equip veterans to begin the form on their own?
- If we needed to shorten this page, is there any information you think we could take out? 
- From what you have seen here, how long do you think completing the form digitally would take you?


**ONE OF THE FOLLOWING DEPENDING ON TIME:**

- Personally, why do you think the VA asks for evidence when applying for disability benefits?
- Do you agree or disagree that the VA expects a reasonable amount of documentation to support a claim for benefits/compensation. Why so?
    - ALT: Do you believe it is necessary for the VA to collect "evidence” from you to support your claim for benefits/compensation? why or why not?
- How would you describe the overall tone of the text on this page? E.G. corporate, warm, cold, etc.


## START PAGE BDD TASKS - 5 MIN

- This section of the interview is a bit different. I’m going to guide you through this portion of the protoype. I’m going to tell you where to click and ask you a few questions about what you see.
- *Imagine you are currently on active duty and looking for information about applying for disability compensation*
- Select “*yes” for question “Are you on Active duty right now”*

**Second page after selecting yes 

- What is your understanding of this page?
- Is it clear which date the form is asking for here? 
- do you think the information on this page could be clearer? how so?
*Click to enter date * *click continue*

**Third page: BDD determination 

- Read through the information here at your own pace.
- In your own words, what is the gist of the information here?
- - do you think the information on this page could be clearer? how so?
- Great! Any last thoughts you want to share before we end?


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## 

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

If participant becomes nervous , anxious, or irritated -

how are you feeling? do you want to take a few minutes to yourself?

You have already helped us a lot and given us some good information, it’s ok to take a break or even end now if you need to

We’ve been talking a lot, do you want to take a break before we start again?
