# Product Outline - Personalized Menu
---

## Overview
When logged in, upon clicking the user’s name in the top right of the screen, there is a mini-menu. This product has been live for some time and has not been modified/updated. 

## Problem Statement
This feature was launched several years ago and has remained untouched for much of that time. 

During [research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2023-06-add-dependents-records-discovery/summary.md) completed in June 2023, we uncovered a trend of users searching for Dependents and Letters from within the profile.

We’re looking to experiment with that menu by adding links to Dependents and Letters. By highlighting some notoriously difficult to find VA.gov content (eg. Dependents and Letters) we suspect we can reduce search for those very same items. 

 
## Desired User Outcomes

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

Users currently open this navigation menu when they navigate to their VA.gov user profile. By adding these items to this menu the hope is that users will not need to search for those items.

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*
Modifying the personalized menu is a developmentally low cost potentially high impact change. 
## Solution Approach


The feature is currently built, this is a minor adjustment/update to what is listed/linked there. 
This proposed change shouldn't have a ton of developoment demands and could be rolled out very quickly allowing us to  guague if our guess is correct. 
Modifying the personalized menu is a small initiative with potentially large impacts to help users.
