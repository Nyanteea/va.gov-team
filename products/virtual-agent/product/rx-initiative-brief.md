# Prescriptions Initiative Brief
#### Overview

<details>
 
 *There is roughly a 1:many relationship between products and initiatives, or our attempts to improve a product/achieve Veteran outcomes. The same goes for product outlines and initiative briefs. This template can be used as product documentation for the Collaboration Cycle, especially when iterating an existing product. In addition, the Brief is an important communication tool within a team and between the team and Crew Chief/PO/other teams.*

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
> ðŸ’¡ *VA.gov products measure success against Ease of use, Service Completion, Trust/Satisfaction, Health.*<sup>1</sup>\
> ðŸ’¡ *Identify balancing metrics to ensure you're not bringing about undesired outcomes.*

- Product KPI | Baseline | Target | Link to data source (e.g. GA, Domo)
* task completion (how many prescriptions get refilled, etc)
* usage (how many people come to chatbot to use the Rx feature)
* usage of voice feature (how many people use the voice component)
* how many people are transferred to live agent
* task completion time (time spent in Rx Skill)

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - will Veterans use the main Rx Skill
  - will Veterans use the Voice activated Skill
  - 
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Is accessibility a concern
  - Voice activation not working
  - Users cannot transition from skill to skill
  - No internationalization of the skill; non-English speakers
  - 

- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Clashing of JOVO, Proxy bot and main chatbot
  - API errors
  - Intent mismatches
  - Authentication issues
  - Inability to communicate with backend server
 
  - Examples:
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Yes, usability testing indicates that Veterans are interested in feature 
  - Yes, examination of chatbot transcripts indicates Veterans are already looking for this information
  - Yes, already consistent with other channels at the VA
