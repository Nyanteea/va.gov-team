### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about [description of your project].

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. Your feedback is helping us improve the language on these pages so it’s a better experience for veterans. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will be compensated regardless of whether you complete the session or answer all of the questions.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with [VA.gov](http://va.gov/). (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes.

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

- Are you currently a veteran or active duty?
- Can you remind me where you are based?
- Can you remind me of whether you have applied for any VA benefits before? (For determining which scenario to present) I worked with a VSO in the past. 
Before working with a VSO, had you tried completing the form on your own? Yeah, I began the process with the VSO. I put in the initial claim when I retired but there has always been a VSO involved. I think the VSO just knows the right questions to ask to make it clearer for us.
Have you looked at the digital form? No.
- What is your experience with VA.gov, if any? My 1st claims in 2007 and over the years the amount of time and the way they complete the process, the length of time seems shorter. I am still going through a claim that leaves you with a lot of questions about where things are. I was scheduled for an appointment, but it was never told to me why I was being seen. 
Any other challenges you have come across? No, I think that is it. I know I can go online and check the status of my claim. I think if the system was more proactive of where your claim is at.

## First Task: [intro & TE alert] - 5 minutes


###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand the intro and what language they find clear/confusing 

- Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario,* 
- Take a moment to look over the page. What is the first thing you would do after arriving on this page? [emphasize more after first few interviews] I see sign in to start and I am familiar with that process because I use MHV all the time. I would do that and begin the process of filling out the application. That would be the starting point. I see there is other information that may be helpful, but for me I would just sign in and start. I would click sign in, get the sign in logins, log in, then it would prefill out all my information.
- Read everything on this page up until the “Sign in” button at your own pace. You can read aloud or to yourself. Try to look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. If questions come up for you as your e reading, feel free to say them out loud.  Let me know when you are finished, and then I will ask you a few questions.
- Do you think the information here could be clearer? how so? I think it works for me because I know some about the PACT and have put in my claim. Everything there makes perfect sense. I know a lot of Veterans who are eligible for benefits but have never applied, who may be a little confused. I think all the information about the PACT is perfectly clear. I think the backdated information may be a little confusing if I was brand new. I would want someone to repeat that to ensure that I understand what is being explained. I think you can point people to seek help if individuals need more help.
What is your understanding on the date here? I understand that if I am approved of my claim, I will get compensation from June to September. Where it is talking about August 2022, say I put in a claim in February does that mean that it would go back to August 2022?
Is it hard to believe that it would go back that far back? From what I know they go back to when you submitted your claim. 
- On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all useful, and 10 being very useful, how useful or not was the information in this section of the page?
    - Why did you choose that number?
-  Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- From what you’ve read here, what is your understanding of who qualifies for benefits under the PACT act?
       alt: if you had to explain the new PACT act to someone else, how would you put it ?      

## Second Task: [STEP 1] Is this the form for you - 10 minutes

###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand step 1 and what language they find clear/confusing + 
gauging expandable sections UX on mobile + gauge expandable alert interaction 

- Same as before: Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario to participant*
- MOBILE: Without clicking on anything just yet, look at the steps listed here. What do they tell you about the process for claiming disability comp. if anything?
As I was reading through, I understood that I met the eligibility requirements.
- From what you have seen so far, what are some actions you think you can take on this page? 

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see when you open section 1?
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section 1 of the form 

- Read Step 1 on this page at your own pace and look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. Let me know when you have finished. Feel free to read out loud or to yourself.  If questions come up for you as your e reading, feel free to say them out loud.

- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful or not was the information in this section? I would say about a 9.
    - Why did you choose that number?
    - Is there information here that you feel is not useful to you?

- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- From what you read, what is your understanding of who is eligible for disability benefits?
   - ALT: If you had to explain to someone else this information about who is eligible for disability benefits, what would you phrase it? You would have served active duty, have some kind of condition that happened on active duty or occurred later due to your service. Say you have respiratory problems later on due to the burn pits you would need to apply.
- From what you read here, what is your understanding of a supplemental claim form? That makes sense to me. I think my claim is a supplemental claim which goes back to looking at my old claims, but also looks at new claims that have to do with the PACT. 
Were some of those claims denied? Some of them were, yes.
Do you think anything is missing? I think you should just add if you need additional assistance, please see a VSO. I am just worried about those with TBIs and PTSD. I just want them to know where to go for help. I know with forms some may feel overwhelmed, and it could be a lot for them to go through.
Do you think a lot of Veterans would go through that? A lot of Veterans I know it would be difficult for them to cope. Their cognitive abilities would make it difficult for them to fill it out on their own.
What would you do next? I know that I am eligible, and in my case, I would file a supplemental claim. I would hit that link there. I haven’t signed in yet, but that would send me to where I need to go.
Did you notice the yellow banner? I did see it, but I did not get there to read it yet.
Would you expect that information to be related to you? Yeah, because I am already rated. 
Open that alert in the yellow banner. Read that and let me know what you think.  
That all makes sense. Nothing confusing to me. 
     - ALT: If you had to explain to someone what a supplemental claim is, how would you phrase it?

QUESTIONS CONCERNING EXPANDABLE ALERT UI/ INFO

- Do you think the alert will contain information relevant to your situation of *insert scenario*? why or why?
- Is this the information you expected to see here? why or why not?
- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer, IF ANY?
- What is your understanding of the information about veterans who have been granted benefits in the past?

### Things to watch for:

- Are certain words/language tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over / miss
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section 

## Third Task: [STEP 2] Decide how to apply - 3 minutes

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see when you open section 2?  I see the option of contacting a VSO and we were talking about that earlier.
Do you think that is in the right place? I would say the earlier you can show that option the better because you never know when a Veteran may bail out on you. For me it works here because I know I would make my way down here. 
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section two
- Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario,* read step 2 on this page at your own pace and look for any information relevant to your situation. If questions come up for you as you're reading, feel free to ask them. 
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section?
    - Why did you choose that number?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Which parts of this section do you think could be clearer, if any?


### Things to watch for:

- How do vets/service members react to mentions of form completion time?
- Are certain words/language tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over / miss
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section 

## Fourth Task: [Step 3] Gather information - 10 minutes

###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand step 1 and what language they find clear/confusing + 
gauging expandable sections UX on mobile + gauge expandable alert interaction 

- IF ON MOBILE: What do you expect to see when you expand section 3? I’m thinking about this part right here. 
Why did that sentence grab your attention? Claims can be complex with multiple conditions. They say they will review your medical records and then they say it would help if you just input your information. If I get into my records, I know I can find that doctor’s note and provide, but to do that for all the conditions I kind of want the VA to be more helpful and get that information from the VA medical records. If it is in their records, they should be able to retrieve that information. It would be more helpful to Veterans to use the technology of today instead of having the Veteran make copies and submit that.
Anything else stick out to you? Private medical records. I get medical care from two places. I would like to think that the VA could access all those records. Sometime when I am seen today, I would be seen by Tricare that if it is something that I have a claim for they would be able to go and see that. 
All you doctors are within the VA system. All the hard copies of my medical records from active duty the VA have them. Some of the medical care is done through Tricare and some through the VA.
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section three
- As before, read through this section at your own pace. Let me know once you’re finished. look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. 
- In your own words, what is the gist of the information in this section?
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section? I would say an 8, and if I read through it closely the first time, I would say a 10.
    - Why did you choose that number?
    - Is there information here that you feel is not useful to you? 
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Was any of this information confusing or unclear?
- What is your understanding of the information you read about how disability compensation is determined?
    ALT: Imagine you needed to explain to someone else how disability compensation is determined? How would you explain it?
- What is your understanding of the information you read about what documents are needed to support a claim for disability benefits?
    - ALT: Imagine you needed to explain to someone this information about the types of documentation needed to support a claim for benefits. How would you explain it to them?
  
**CHECK TIME**

- Was anything confusing about the information pertaining to authorizing the VA to receive and review your medical records?
- Was anything confusing about the information concerning where to submit forms for claiming PTSD or unemployability?

QUESTIONS CONCERNING EXPANDABLE UI/INFO - BDD

- Do you think the alert will contain information relevant to your situation of *insert scenario*? why or why not?
- Before you opened this section, was this the information you expected to see here? Why or why not? Is this just related to PTSD or related to any condition. I have a condition right now that they think may be related to a situation that occurred during my active duty. As I read through it again, it is not confusing, and it is separate.
- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer, if any?
- In your own words, what is your understanding of the benefits delivery at discharge program?
    - If you had to explain the Benefits Delivery at Discharge program to someone else, how 
       would you do that? 

### Things to watch for:

- Are certain words/language tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over/miss 
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section


## Fifth Task: [Step 4] Apply - 8 minutes

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see in this section? Everything that I read there is everything that I experienced when I put in my supplemental claim earlier this year. We made our intent to file and about 6 weeks later I put in my supplemental claim. Now that we are at the later end, I think it has been longer than 4 months, I know my claim in active.
How do you feel about the time frame being there? I think it is okay. I would have someone go back and see if that is really what the Veterans are experiencing. If it does not match the actual timeline, I would update that time frame with the newest time frame that Veterans are experiencing throughout the country.
Would you say it is better to have a wrong time frame rather than no time frame? No, I would give them a time frame, but I would give them the best ballpark window rather than nothing at all. I think everything here is good and not confusing at all.
Is there anything you wish you would have known before starting the claim process? I think just knowing how the process works. I just met a Veteran who was eligible but had never filed. I think VSOs need to get their arms around those who really need assistance and help them.
Do you think the VA is getting their arms around Veterans? I think those hired within San Diego are doing everything in their power to help.
Is this information clear here? I would come back and ask comeback questions. When I stopped working, I had terminal leave. If you have leave leftover, you can use that as terminal leave. Say you have 60 days in your book, but your last day of work is in December. Here I would ask what it would have been, would it be the last day of work, or would it be when I got my DD-214.
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section four
- Read through section at your own pace…
- In your own words, what is the gist of the information in this section? It all makes sense. I am going to continue to read. That all makes sense. I know active-duty folks going through this process get some kind of information that is similar to this. I know there are some that are taking advantage of it.
Is there anything here that would be confusing? I would say again, if there is something that is confusing there is a place for them to go to get more help.
What would you do here, would you put a date or ask for help? I would put in the date that I stopped working. That would be the date I put in. 
If you had that terminal leave, it would be the date you started the terminal leave? It would be the date I started the terminal leave because you can always be called back. You are still on active duty you are just at home. You are just using it up your leave. The word separate is what is causing me confusion. When I separated to go on terminal leave, I was still on active duty.
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section?
    - Why did you choose that number?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Which parts of this section do you think could be clearer?
- If you had to explain "intent to file" to someone else, how would you put it?
- What did you think when you read the text about the length of time the VA takes to make a decision?
   - Did you find that information useful or not useful?

**If not mentioned before and within the allotted time:**

- What is your understanding of the information regarding additional forms like those for dependents and aid?

SENTIMENT AND TRUST TESTING 

- In your opinion, is there a difference between the words “condition” and “disability”?
- On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all prepared and 10 being extremely prepared, how prepared or not do you feel to begin the 526 form after reading this page?
- How likely or unlikely would you be to reach out to a VSO for help  completing the form?
- Now that you have read through this page, is there any information missing from this page that you feel is needed to equip veterans to begin the form on their own?
- If we needed to shorten this page, is there any information you think we could take out? 
- From what you have seen here, how long do you think completing the form digitally would take you?


**ONE OF THE FOLLOWING DEPENDING ON TIME:**

- Personally, why do you think the VA asks for evidence when applying for disability benefits?
- Do you agree or disagree that the VA expects a reasonable amount of documentation to support a claim for benefits/compensation. Why so?
    - ALT: Do you believe it is necessary for the VA to collect "evidence” from you to support your claim for benefits/compensation? why or why not?
- How would you describe the overall tone of the text on this page? E.G. corporate, warm, cold, etc.


## START PAGE BDD TASKS - 5 MIN

- This section of the interview is a bit different. I’m going to guide you through this portion of the protoype. I’m going to tell you where to click and ask you a few questions about what you see.
- *Imagine you are currently on active duty and looking for information about applying for disability compensation*
- Select “*yes” for question “Are you on Active duty right now”*

**Second page after selecting yes 

- What is your understanding of this page?
- Is it clear which date the form is asking for here?
- do you think the information on this page could be clearer? how so? 
*Click to enter date * *click continue*

**Third page: BDD determination

- - do you think the information on this page could be clearer? how so?
- Great! Any last thoughts you want to share before we end?


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## 

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

If participant becomes nervous , anxious, or irritated -

how are you feeling? do you want to take a few minutes to yourself?

You have already helped us a lot and given us some good information, it’s ok to take a break or even end now if you need to

We’ve been talking a lot, do you want to take a break before we start again?
