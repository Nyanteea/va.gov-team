# Designing for the VA Mobile App  

Last updated: Nov 6, 2024

This is a list (created by the VA mobile design team) of items and resources that are essential for designers who are new to the VA mobile app (and potentially new to designing for native mobile in general) to know about as they’re getting up to speed.


## Step 1. Check out the VA mobile app on your own!

Get to know the VA mobile app and experience the product onboarding journey. Doing this on an actual mobile device (as opposed to looking at comps in Figma) is essential to a solid understanding of interactions in the app.


* Review the app store presence and download the app on your own mobile device:
    * [VA: Health and Benefits - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.va.mobileapp&hl=en_US&pli=1)
    * [VA: Health and Benefits on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/va-health-and-benefits/id1559609596) 
* Get into [demo mode for the VA mobile app](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/Mobile%20Demo%20Mode) and explore!
* If you have more than one type of mobile device (Android, iPhone, iPad), feel free to install there to see differences between platforms & form factors


## Step 2. Check out these VA mobile resources:

These resources explain how the mobile app team works and our processes, as well as links to our Design System and the Flagship mobile design library (including the app’s screen templates, patterns & components).

## Step 3. Get up to speed on native mobile best practice resources

If you’re new to designing for native mobile (or maybe it’s time for a refresher?), spend some time getting to know Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and Google’s Materials design guidelines. The VA mobile app’s design is based on principles and best practices from a combination of guidelines that are used by all native mobile apps:



* [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-ios) (iOS/Apple) 
* [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) (Android/Google)
