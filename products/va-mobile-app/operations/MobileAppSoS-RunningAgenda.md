## Notes

## 7/25/23 Agenda:
* Q3 Projects in Progress
   *  Secure Messaging - Migrate to Re-Engineered MHV APIs
      * Met with Christy and found they plan to be done with their work by the 1st week of Sept - asking when we could slate the work - earliest would be Sprint 80 (9/13) 
* Question for the POs
   * Any new work we should be on the lookout for?
   * Any priority shifts?
* Sprint 77 Planning (Adam)
   * Review [Sprint 76 SoS board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/823/views/3) to see what is currently slated

## 7/18/23 Agenda: 
 * SoS is being used this day for Sprint Planning for Sprin 76
 * Sprint Planning Slides [Mobile Team Sprint Planning - Sprint 76.pdf](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/12088648/Mobile.Team.Sprint.Planning.-.Sprint.76.pdf)
 * Additional discussions needed on the process to handle pulling in tickets that were not planned - Jennifer to followup with Matt on coordination


## 7/11/23 Agenda and Meeting Notes 
 * Q3 Projects in Progress
    * RX carryover 
         * Meko verified its tied to the extra events Greta has spoken about, Binny confirmed status an be moved to green 
    * Cancel Message content audit 
         * Stacy -continuing to work on this so that we can move from yellow to green before the end of Sprint 75. Asked if Eng had anything further to add, Binny validated that this will be done.
    * EVSS
         * Kelly - updated that our team is doing well but are blocked by VA and LH. We are ready with Claims status and are waiting until VA is in Production; Letters is at 95% and will likely be ready for PROD before Claims.
    * SM Realignement Update 
         * Project missing from list above - project added back in 
         * working through staging bug issues ; experienced issue with adding threads to folders / inbox as originally planned ; SM MHV did not support
         * PO asked Product to coordinate a meeting with Leila Rassi (Octo owner of MHV SM) to review what Mobile is doing for SM 
    * Appointments 
         * Meko to update project list with Appointment as they are separate not together 
         * There are two tickets tied to appointments - CMP, removing the cancel button has been completed and are targeting the August 1 release and we are aligned with the Appts team; Appointments team has been updated. 
         * The other item is for Audits and that ticket is still in review.
    * Check-in
         *  Meko: question for Rachel: on Check-in, it sounds like some of the other teams are splitting the eng team between a couple of projects through August. Kay is managing two of these initiatives
         *  Rachel had not had a chance to talk to Kay about these and will touch base with her.
         *  Rachel met with Shane Elliot OCTO for SMS content - sounds like low effort to modify and just needes content from us 
    * POs would like the Estimated Timelines added to the card on the SoS board - Rachel looks at Kanban first then quarters than Sprint 
         * Completed 7/13 - comments made on tickets for details 
             * We have no timelines for alternate projects thus can't provide one so added Alternative Project in project name to differentiate
             * Used 100% Release field so it appears on the card - not this only depicts work planned for Q3 for that step; if we know work will also be continued into Q4 (Detox UI, Remote Disaster, Travel) the date depicts end of Q3 date of 10/10
             * Based on history timing will change and PMs will need to update the Epic in the Kanban as they change and also when the ture 100% release happens

 *  PO's project priorirt list (Adam)
    * Matt indicated the priority is set in the [SoS Board in the Sprints Tab](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/823/views/3) as its sorted by Epic
    * [SoS Board in the Sprints Tab](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/823/views/3) will be the source of truth for Mobile to follow
    * If the POs want to modify the priority then once that change is communicated then the SoS board can be update 
     
 * Question for the POs - any unplanned work that needs reviewed / prioritized? (Adam)
   * Web Banner - Meeting with Dave Conlan on 7/18
       * not sure what will come of it but our our scope and work has been completed and shared
       * Rachel directed to default to no work or very minimal 
         * believes there are questions tied to the events for their tracking purposes 
         * PM to provide update to Rachel post meeting  
   * Design Jam Session on app's home page around notifications
       * Is this related to a planned Q3 project or is there possible future work we need to be aware of 
   * Holly reviewed possible design work to fill unplanned capacity asked for PO approval to proceed with at least ST 
        * Identified while working on In-App recruitment
        * Identified that we are out of alignment of Va.gov design library 
        * recommended some short term work but also added the long term aspect of this is to update the home page (discussed during Nav 2.0 with past PO)
        * Ryan indicated he wanted to focus on known issues and those that align with future work especially ones that can be measured impact
            * Ryan indicated he did not think it was urgent to align with Va.gov design library on mobile alerts
            * Ryan indicated that Jen, Rachel, Ryan have talked about low hanging fruit that is Veteran facing like Labs and Test for Q3
            * Rachel / Ryan confirmed if the issue is accessibility related then would support pursuing 
        * Next steps
            * Jen to lead additional conversations 
            * Jen to provide Rachel / Ryan with a list of design work and other possible work to consider per PO's request 
                * Rachel asked if Jen to prioritize based on the following
                     1.) Focus on areas with the least amount of unknowns
                     2.) Work that is easy to shuffle in and out 
    * General awareness - no mobile action - Health Portfolio is working on a Go / No Go for SM update
         * Phase 0 go / no go targeting next week
         * This could lead to more questions around SM experience that Rachel will need help with 
         * Discussion on if we should bump up SM dashboard work - Rachel indicated to keep with current priority for now
    * Dashboard prioritization - could we align updates with MHV.gov release plan 
          
     
 * Sprint Planning update (Matt)
   * Team had a sprint planning workshop on 7/10
   * Changes will be made gradually to improve this process
   * Mobile meeting with POs 7/12 to discuss further details 

* Sprint 76 Planning (Adam)
   * Past convos talked about using SoS pre-sprint planning meeting to help with sprint planning?
   * This will likely change over time but taking a first stab at is 
       * Reminder that the SoS Board used for Q3 is used for our Sprint Planning prep as work is broken out by various sprints
       * Review [Sprint 76 SoS board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/823/views/3) to see what is currently slated
   * Reviewed board 
       * Discussions on if we can pull up work given 76 / 77 PM and BE have extra capacity
       * This is what is tentatively planned - not that some work may carryover also that some of the sizing is estimates and could change - difficult to say we have extra capacity but could
       * Jayson indicated user endpoint work can be pulled in early
       * No action taken



## 6/13/23
* User Retention Research - Liz
    * We'd like to start this right away
    * Please surface any questions you may have 
    * Liz to post the Research plan for Rachel & Ryan to review
* Sprint Capacity Planning - Content capacity  
    * Misty has 10 planned points for Sprint 74 but capacity is only at 5
    * Affects Check In and Confirmation Message Audit epics
    * Have worked ahead a bit on audit epic and hoping to reduce points for work in this sprint, encompassing really only QA'ing content and helping answer questions that come up from implementation.
* In-App Recruitment Step 2 (Adam)
    * Thanks Ryan for confirming we can use the Perigean link; Danielle will be included in content approval- [Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C018V2JCWRJ/p1686256275924369)
    * Dependency - We will need Kevin Hoffman / Danielle Thierry approval before implementing as they are not currently looking to increase their recruitment database size (see Slack thread for more details)
    * Proceeding with Step 2 focusing on UX design and business logic per Po's approval last demo
 * Secure Messaging - Realignment with Web (Adam)
    * Identified threading work needs to carry over 5654 ; Worked with Binny and will be picking this up 
 * Secure Messaging - Migrate to Re-Engineered Patient APIs (Adam) 
    * Meeting scheduled for Friday with MHV SM team including Mobile's Binny, Jayson and myself
    * Will have more of an update post meeting 
    * Open items: still awaiting ICD and updated schedule from MHV SM
 * EVSS Migration updates


## 5/31/23
* Preferred & Gender Identity Post release Bug identified
  * Authentication rule missed during implementation thatpreferred name and gender id updates are only available for idme and logingov user
  * Fix put in place by BE to update policy, but an issue was identifed on Friday by QA that when attempting to update Gender identity a service call was repeatadly being made and user hangs on a loading screen.  BE fix was needed as it was released in prod.  Next steps in handling this scenario for FE.  Do we show message to user upfront that they are not able to update, do we show messaging when user attempts the update, and what type of servicing error will come back from backend.   I have reached out to the accountexp-authexp team to see how they are handling message display in prod for web [DSVA thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1685471206085409).  
* Ticket Management - PO approval on closing tickets not yet worked that are 1 year or older (anything older than 6/1/2022) - Adam
    * A lot has changed in the last 1 year which means they are likely outdated and will need a new ticket created with updated details and information before they can get prioritized
    * Tickets that are closed are still reecords in the system that can be reviewed if needed 
    * Goal - establishing such a practice will help keep the board clean by having relevant tickets on the board 
    * Expect we will learn as we do this but feel this is a solid first step
* Sprint Capacity Planning - QA capacity  
    * QA Team is facing over capacity 
    * QA does not have enough capacity to validate all new work and catchup work 
    * Therese reviewed upcoming sprints and increased QA capacity to better align and identified projects with no QA capacity associated with them but anticipate they will 
    * Need to set up a QA sizing process 
    * Leads need to discuss further and decide how we want to handle
       * EVSS and SM have external deadlines 

* C&P Appointments - C&P appointments are displayed in the VAOS application.   As of late April, the appointments team made some updates to the upcoming/past appt list to display Compensation & Pension as the appt type vs. the service type (i.e. Audiology & speech).  Additionally, a recent change request was implemented to not allow for these appt types to be canceled via VAOS and the user has to call the facility to make a change
  * Request for mobile to implement the above changes; originally to ensure functionality to not allow cancel, however in review it looks as though mobile needs to make additional appt list view changes to reflect the display of the appts.  Next step: priorize work/timing
  * Appt team, ticket references: [56997](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/appointments-team-603fdef281af6500110a1691/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/56997)- Display C&P Appointments on the appt list(upcoming & past) and [57824](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/appointments-team-603fdef281af6500110a1691/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/57824)-Set cancellable false for Comp & pension appts
  * We need to determine priority of this work

* Check-in
  * Veterans will need to text a VA number and VA will text them back
  * Working on the content of the message
  * Meko to work with Laurie on Check-in team to ensure they are creating tickets for this work
  * Shawn also proposed sending Push Notifications
    * Meko & Rachel to discuss further
 
 * VBA had a data request last week
  * miscommunication on this request - in the future if anyone outside of our team asks for data, include Rachel & Ryan so they can help prioritize requests

## 5/23/23
* Sprint 72 Planning [Mobile Team Sprint Planning - Sprint 72.pdf](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/11554612/Mobile.Team.Sprint.Planning.-.Sprint.72.pdf)



## 5/16/23

Check-In
* Team is working on providing LOE estimate for 2 check-in user experience flows 'check-in w/pre-registration & check-in w/out pre-registration.  Target to have estimates by Wed 5/16. Being tracked [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/5670)
* Push Notifications - Most of this effort is coordination that will need to be done w/check in team, Vetext/VaNotify (no implementation work on mobile).  If this is required for MVP, engagement will be needed with VeText/VANotify, are they in line with MVP timelines etc.
* Deep Linking - Will require a team spike (research time) to explore what would be involved and needed to implempement deep linking on the app
* There was an ask by Kay to add 'my-health-APPOINTMENTS' label to our check in Epic so that it would appear on the Unified Appointments Experience board.  It doesn't look like we are on the same repository and do not have access to adding the label and linking.  Need PO support on how to go about linking.  [Unified Appointments Experience Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/unified-appointments-experience-includes-mhv-to-vagov-check-in-mobile-etc-63d9ef2effd69b002641127b/board)
  * Ryan to find out
* Call Center Hand-off - may be another team to do MVP
  * Ryan to follow up with Rachel about meeting on 24th
* Better monitoring of any API outages - SM went down and we weren't sure of the process
  * There is confusion around who is responsible for alerting of outages, especially on off-hours.  Platform has on-call rotations but our program doesn't have the same.  Previously we have been advised to not alert upstream teams to errors we see as they should already be aware, so we didn't alert of the SM outage. 
* Providing alerts on important events in a Veteran's life - [Event Bus](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VES/blob/master/initiatives/Invest%20in%20an%20event%20driven%20architecture.md) ETA Jan 2024
* Moving Sprint Demo to current Sprint 0 time slot and vice versa.
  * Confirm over Slack, want to ensure we get Rachel's feedback.  Ryan is ok with that change.



---------------

## 5/9/23

Sprint Demo meeting  - is there a better time slot?

EVSS Migration - data discrpencies
  * New claims Status data source does not include the VA Representative (removed because it was misleading)
  * We have concerns about removing it from the Claims tool in the app because there is no where else that provides this information.  
  * We could use help understanding how VA.gov made the decision to remove it

-----------------


## 5/2/23

Preferred Name & Gender Go/Live  on hold
  * Team currently troubleshooting, lag in update identified in during UAT.  Requires multiple update attempts to populate Preferred Name & Gender Identity issue #[5548](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/5548) 

Secure Messaging - MHV Re-engineering SM PAtient APIs & Mobile having to migrate  
  * This is completely separate work than the Secure Messaging Alignment (copy, attachment, categories, etc) work 
  * Late March MHV notified Mobile that they are re-engineering APIs for Secure Messaging Patient APIs - no functionality changes just moving to a new platform 
  * This requires Mobile to migrate to these APIs on the new platform in order to keep Secure Messaging functioning (May 31st is when MHV targeted their work completed ; Needed Mobile to migrate by 8/22) 
  * Given this mobile is entirely dependent on MHV as it's their APIs that need to be completed 
  * Informed last week that this timing may be at risk - no timeline given - delays some Q2 planned capacity (BE mainly) till later into Q2 and likely early Q3 
  * Next step is to meet with them in June 
  * I made this a separate item above   

Digital Decision Letters
  * All set to go live 5/9
  * Notifying VBA stakeholders

Figma Shipped Files
  * Ryan curious the effort we put into Design Ops tasks
    * VA.gov doesn't do the same process
    * We are putting more effort in right now but it won't always be this effort-heavy, going forward designs will go from working files into Shipped files.  We just need to build them out to start right now.
    * Ryan curious if there is a way to use the Shipped Files in Figma with his Data Dictionary work he is doing

-----------------

## 4/25/23
Discussion Items 
* Experience and worked through resource constraints in Sprint 69 
  * Overcame this challenge through positive team work and communicaiton - great job team!! 
* What's New in-app UI - what threshold do we want to use for utilization of the What's New alert on the app Home screen?
  * We will put both DDL and PNGI into the What's New Alert for this release.
* Pulling in Check-In Discover into Sprint 70 
  * This work was not planned for Sprint 70 so pulling it in means we need to remove work to compensate for the infusion of capacity to perform this work
