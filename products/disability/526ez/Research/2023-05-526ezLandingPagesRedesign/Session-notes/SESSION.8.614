## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about [description of your project].

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. Your feedback is helping us improve the language on these pages so its a better experience for veterans. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will be compensated regardless of whether you complete the session or answer all of the questions.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with [VA.gov](http://va.gov/). (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

- Are you currently a veteran or active duty?
- Can you remind me where you are based?
- Can you remind me of whether you have applied for any VA benefits before? (for determining which scenario to present)
- What is your experience with VA.gov, if any?

## First Task: [intro & TE alert] - 5 minutes


###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand the intro and what language they find clear/confusing 

- Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario,* 
- Take a moment to look over the page. What is the first thing you would do after arriving on this page? [emphasize more after first few interviews] I would sign in. 
- Read everything on this page up until the “Sign in” button at your own pace. You can read aloud or to yourself. Try to look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. If questions come up for you as your e reading, feel free to say them out loud.  Let me know when you are finished, and then I will ask you a few questions. I was already told that this form would be for me, and so I would want to fill it out.
Have you taken steps to file a claim? I have not yet.
Are you interested in doing so? I am 90% certain I will.
What is the 10%? I am not sure because I have not been diagnosed with something that falls under the PACT Act. 
Have you filed a claim in the past? Yes.
How did you find the process? I am pondering because I have not gone to sleep yet. The process for me was okay because I am somewhat tech savvy. For me I was able to navigate through it and I had some assistance from a VSO. I found some parts a little confusing. I filed a claim on the intent to file, and I have several claims to file in the initial claim that would not allow me to file. The main page would not let me add all the issues to the page. I had to contact the 1-800 number and they told me that if I file within that month, it should be put together into one claim. When I got cut off on the VA website and called the help desk, they stated if I lump in the rest of the claims within the year and I finished it did not lump together like they told me it would work. It was confusing and disappointing. Especially since some of those claims were approved later on.
- Do you think the information here could be clearer? how so? No not really.
- On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all useful, and 10 being very useful, how useful or not was the information in this section of the page? I would go with a 10.
    - Why did you choose that number?
-  Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know? As we speak, I don’t see anything that strikes me as missing.
Were your claims accepted? Some of them yes.
- From what you’ve read here, what is your understanding of who qualifies for benefits under the PACT act?
       alt: if you had to explain the new PACT act to someone else, how would you put it ?      I would direct them to Google University or VA website because I don’t think I would be the know all be all about that information. I wouldn’t want to be the one to explain something that could affect them or their family.
Was anything surprising? My limited understanding is that you had 2 years of the PACT that you had to file a claim. I learned that from different forums that had information about that. 

## Second Task: [STEP 1] Is this the form for you - 10 minutes

###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand step 1 and what language they find clear/confusing + 
gauging expandable sections UX on mobile + gauge expandable alert interaction 

- Same as before: Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario to participant*
- MOBILE: Without clicking on anything just yet, look at the steps listed here. What do they tell you about the process for claiming disability comp. if anything? I would like to click on this form for you. I would expect to see a list to tell me if I should fill this form out.
- From what you have seen so far, what are some actions you think you can take on this page? 

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see when you open section 1?
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section 1 of the form 

- Read Step 1 on this page at your own pace and look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. Let me know when you have finished. Feel free to read out loud or to yourself.  If questions come up for you as your e reading, feel free to say them out loud.

- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful, or not was the information in this section? I would give it a 10.
    - Why did you choose that number?
    - Is there information here that you feel is not useful to you? No, it was straightforward and to the point.
What is the most important information here? I would like to click on the have you been granted benefits parts, but we are not there yet. It is all important. It fits together. 
Do you feel like anything in here is not important right now? This is specifically about the PACT. It is the same wording that you would see if you were filing for any claim. I do not see any specific to the PACT, like a list of what you may need to qualify for the PACT.

- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- From what you read, what is your understanding of who is eligible for disability benefits?
   - ALT: If you had to explain to someone else this information about who is eligible for disability benefits, what would you phrase it? I wasn’t sure what I would see there, but there is information there that I wasn’t aware of because I had never done that before. I may do it now because this gave me clarification. 
- From what you read here, what is your understanding of a supplemental claim form? It is something you file after you file your initial claim with supporting documentation.
     - ALT: If you had to explain to someone what a supplemental claim is, how would you phrase it?

QUESTIONS CONCERNING EXPANDABLE ALERT UI/ INFO

- Do you think the alert will contain information relevant to your situation of *insert scenario*? why or why?
- Is this the information you expected to see here? why or why not?
- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer, IF ANY?
- What is your understanding of the information about veterans who have been granted benefits in the past?

### Things to watch for:

- Are certain words/langauge tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over / miss
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section 

## Third Task: [STEP 2] Decide how to apply - 3 minutes

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see when you open section 2? 
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section two
- Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario,* read step 2 on this page at your own pace, and look for any information relevant to your situation. If questions come up for you as you're reading, feel free to ask them. 
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section? I would give it a 10.
You mentioned you worked with a VSO, how did that come about? That is a good question. I would have to think about it. Someone had suggested it.
Before you worked with a VSO, had you started the claim before? I started a claim back in 1972, and back then I don’t think VSO did not exist. I didn’t work with a claim process until about 3-4 years ago. There was a 60-year gap. 
The 3-4 years ago was alone? No that was with a VSO.
    - Why did you choose that number?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Which parts of this section do you think could be clearer, if any? Not at all.


### Things to watch for:

## Fourth Task: [Step 3] Gather information - 10 minutes

###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand step 1 and what language they find clear/confusing + 
gauging expandable sections UX on mobile + gauge expandable alert interaction 

- IF ON MOBILE: What do you expect to see when you expand section 3?
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section three
- As before, read through this section at your own pace. Let me know once you’re finished. look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. 
- In your own words, what is the gist of the information in this section? Okay I like it. It was clear and to the point.

- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Was any of this information confusing or unclear?
- What is your understanding of the information you read about how disability compensation is determined?
    ALT: Imagine you needed to explain to someone else how disability compensation is determined? How would you explain it? My understanding echoes what is written in this article. It is a clear explanation there. It just sums it up. 
What is the most important information here? The Supporting document lists. Some people would not know. It is something that could easily be missed.
Did you notice the alert at the bottom there? Yeah. 
When you click on that what are you expecting? I would expect to see information about how to apply.
- What is your understanding of the information you read about what documents are needed to support a claim for disability benefits?

## Fifth Task: [Step 4] Apply - 8 minutes

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see in this section?
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section four
- Read through section at your own pace…
- In your own words, What is the gist of the information in this section?
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section?
    - Why did you choose that number?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Which parts of this section do you think could be clearer? I think you’ve done a good job. I don’t see anything.
Is this the information you were expecting? I would think it could be a little clearer about submitting documentation. I will explain how to submit the documentation. I would also add that you can submit supporting documents written by family members and fellow service members that could support your claim. It says you would see a confirmation page it should also say that you have a year to submit any medical records, buddy statements, or other provider notes to this claim. 
Do you think we should change the time format? No because they do have 1 year submit the supporting documentation, but the sooner the better to not prolong the decision of your claim. I would like to get mine done a lot sooner. I have had things pending since 2001. As a Veteran we need everything we can to speed this along. There are different forums on different websites. Anything that affects me or my family I want to know what it is. Knowledge is power.
What websites are you on for these forums? I have been on Reddit, Facebook, and I have been on other websites. I searched and looked around. 
- If you had to explain "intent to file" to someone else, how would you put it?
- What did you think when you read the text about the length of time the VA takes to make a decision? Sure. It should probably say, “It probably take longer.” I am kind of kidding, but I am kind of not. I know there are other factors that can affect the length of time it takes to have a turnaround on your claim. 
I have heard whispers, but I am not too aware. What are your thoughts on that process? I feel like most Veterans, if it is going to speed the process along bring it on. If it brings on errors that would be a concern.
Do you feel like the VA is asking for a reasonable amount of documentation? The more documentation it will tip the scale to the issues. If there is evidence submit it to help you. 
Can you highlight some of those questions about the process as you were going through it? I don’t know if it pertains. I had a CNP exam, and I had a medical opinion that was issued in my favor, and for some reason the VA got another opinion without another exam, and it was not in my favor but the favor of the VA. Unfortunately, I haven’t gotten a decision on that, and it is still pending. I don’t think it will not be favorable in my side. And if I appeal that opinion if I could come up with evidence that wasn’t there, but there was already a lot of evidence there. This was already an appeal on the original claim.
Is there a difference in the words condition and disability? Yeah. A condition does not equal to a disability because I don’t think there are a lot of us that don’t have a condition. 
What about the word contention? We apply to something, but it goes back to evidence. There are some people that think the world is flat and evidence doesn’t make a difference. 
What level of preparedness do you feel like you have now that you have gone through this? Do you have insight into my rating? No, I do not have insight into that.
How prepared do you feel about beginning a claim after reading through this? I do have claims I am looking to file once this issue is resolved. One of them being one that has to do with the PACT, but I am waiting to get more information.
   - Did you find that information useful or not useful?

**If not mentioned before and within the allotted time:**

- What is your understanding of the information regarding additional forms like those for dependents and aid?

SENTIMENT AND TRUST TESTING 

- In your opinion, is there a difference between the words “condition” and “disability”?
- On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all prepared and 10 being extremely prepared, how prepared or not do you feel to begin the 526 form after reading this page?
- How likely or unlikely would you be to reach out to a VSO for help  completing the form?
- Now that you have read through this page, is there any information missing from this page that you feel is needed to equip veterans to begin the form on their own?
- If we needed to shorten this page, is there any information you think we could take out? 
- From what you have seen here, how long do you think completing the form digitally would take you?


**ONE OF THE FOLLOWING DEPENDING ON TIME:**

- Personally, why do you think the VA asks for evidence when applying for disability benefits?
- Do you agree or disagree that the VA expects a reasonable amount of documentation to support a claim for benefits/compensation. Why so?
    - ALT: Do you believe it is necessary for the VA to collect "evidence” from you to support your claim for benefits/compensation? why or why not?
- How would you describe the overall tone of the text on this page? E.G. corporate, warm, cold, etc.

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

If participant becomes nervous , anxious, or irritated -

how are you feeling? do you want to take a few minutes to yourself?

You have already helped us a lot and given us some good information, it’s ok to take a break or even end now if you need to

We’ve been talking a lot, do you want to take a break before we start again?
