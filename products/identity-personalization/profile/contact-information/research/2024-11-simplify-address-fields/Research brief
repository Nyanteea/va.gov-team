# Address Fields Discovery


## Background

Based on information from teams, we wanted to discover how we might revise the address fields in the Contact Information section (product) of the Profile page on VA.gov.

Observations leading to this thinking included:
- The unusual structure of the address fields in Contact Information: "Street address", "Street address line 2", and "Street address line 3"

- That these do not match patterns in PDF versions of forms

- Current hint text may not match the mental modesl of users nor the models of forms 

Based on this, we wanted to discover any technical or pattern blocks to simplifying the forms, with the hypothesis that this could lead to fewer entry errors, which in turn would lead to better delivery of services to Veterans.

## Activities

- Review the existing work on Contact Information address screens

- Work with BE engineers to map out how the data from Contact Information is stored and accessed by other teams, products and forms

- Hold conversations with teams that manage and consume this data

- Discover whether the three fields are all critical to any systems

- Collaborate to build a visual map of the data paths and availability from the Contact Information product

## Discussion

In conversations with Mike Richard of the VA Profile team and Tricia Baker of the VFF team, we learned that any change to the structure of the address fields, such as changing to two fields, would break the data structures on various backend systems. Therefore, this was not an option for any design exporation or change, at least currently. 
However, we did leard that our existing hint text did not match any of what exists in print or digital versions of the forms that the Contact Information would pre-fill.

## Recommendations
- Do not make changes to the three-line structure of address fields in Contact Information

- Build new ticket, based on research with teams that consume the Contact Information, as discovered in the course of this ticket, to build new hint text for the address fields that better match where the data will go.
